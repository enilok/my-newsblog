    <p class="pick"><b id="news"> Argentina captain, Lionel Messi, has reacted on social media in a shell-shocked manner after his country suffered a dramatic 2-1 defeat against Morocco in their 2024 Paris Olympic opening clash yesterday.Argentina were down 2-1 when a massive 15-minute injury time was added at the end of 90 minutes.
        Cristian Medina looked to have scored a late equalizer to secure a 2-2 draw for La Albiceleste.However, the game was interrupted as angry Moroccan fans entered the stadium.
 The match was temporarily suspended and after almost two hours, a VAR check confirmed that the goal was ruled out because of offside.The remaining three-plus minutes were played as players re-emerged in an empty stadium.The match ended 2-1 win in favour of Morocco, sparking a reaction from Messi on social media.The Inter Miami captain wrote on his Instagram story:
         “Insolito (Spanish).” “Unbelievable (English).”
 Messi is currently recovering from an ankle injury he sustained during Argentina’s Copa America triumph over Colombia.The former Barcelona captain is not part of Argentina’s squad at Olympics.</b></p>

    <p id="pick"><u id="headline" >Ex-Gunner urges Arsenal to go for “someone like Toney” as Havertz’s backup</u></p>
    <p class="pick"><b id="page" >Next season, we anticipate Kai Havertz to lead Arsenal’s attack. As much as we expect him to, he is not a machine and cannot be relied on as the only reliable striker. Gabriel Jesus, the our previous first-choice striker, hasn’t clicked leading the attack since the Qatar World Cup, and many are pressing for a change, and there’s a suggestion he could now play on the right wing instead.Arsenal may need to look for a backup to Havertz, and former Gunner Stewart Robson has just mentioned why the club should consider acquiring Ivan Toney. Robson sees Toney as a great “super sub” that Arsenal could introduce in games to win, while also counting on him to fill in for Havertz while he is rested for high-stakes games.</b></p>
