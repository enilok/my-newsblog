    <h3>Brain Jotter's usage of Gentleman Mike Ejeagha’s song: Is he guilty of copyright infringement?</h3>
    <p id="publish" >In 1983, Nigerian iconic Igbo folk and highlife musician Gentleman Mike Ejeagha recorded the song ‘Ka Esi Le Onye Isi Oche’ off the album ‘Akuko N’egwu’.The single made a sensational comeback 41 years later after it was used in a viral video that features catchy dance moves by skit maker Brain Jotter.Since the video was posted on his Instagram on July 5, 2024, it has been viewed 29.1 million times with over 30,000 comments. On TikTok, it has been viewed 19.6 million times generating over 23,000 comments. The viral video has since sparked a trend on social media with thousands of users posting their videos with the song.Amidst the renewed virality of the song, the 90-year-old musician and his work became a subject of interest for social media users and music aficionados. With goodwill pouring in, Brain Jotter offered Gentleman Mike ₦2 million.
        For many, it was a generous sum. But critics have blasted the act by Brain Jotter as a rip-off, accusing him of copyright infringement of the Igbo folk musician as he didn't get his permission before using the song in his viral video.
